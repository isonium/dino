# Probability

The field `probability` are percentages from three different classifiers. If at least two of them predict with a percentage of at least 66% that a message is spam, then it will be labeled as such.

The first number is from XGBoost, the second from a Random Forest, and the third SVC with a polynomial kernel. The third number is always either `0` or `1`, and never a fraction.
